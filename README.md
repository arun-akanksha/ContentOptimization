Project Summary: Research:
The research focused on analyzing the landscape of content offered across various streaming platforms. Key areas of investigation included identifying the most popular tags and genres based on the quantity of content offered and their corresponding ratings. Additionally, the study aimed to create a weighted average score for ratings to evaluate both quantity and quality together. The research also delved into assessing the popularity of content across different platforms and determining success metrics to formulate a targeted strategy.

Limitations:
Several limitations were encountered during the research process. These included the availability and reliability of data sources, potential subjectivity in evaluating success metrics, and variations in content popularity and success across different platforms. Additionally, the study may have been constrained by the scope of analysis and the dynamic nature of the streaming industry.

Solutions and Conclusions:
To address the identified limitations and capitalize on research findings, several solutions and conclusions are proposed:
Focus on Original and Exclusive Content: Increasing the production of original and exclusive content can help attract and retain subscribers.
Acquire Rights for Successful Content: Acquiring rights to successful content, particularly in popular genres and tags, can enhance the platform's offerings.
Targeted Strategy for Platform Success: Developing a success metric tailored to each platform can guide content acquisition and production strategies effectively.
Emphasis on TV Shows and Niche Categories: Given the higher success rates observed for TV shows and niche categories like Travel, LGBTQ, and Home & Garden, allocating resources towards producing content in these areas can yield positive results.
Evaluation of Key Success Metrics: IMDB ratings can serve as a reliable success metric, but it's crucial to evaluate both significant and insignificant metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of content performance.
Strategic Content Acquisition: Prioritizing content creation or acquisition in genres like Exclusive Content, Based on True Story, Crime, Fantasy, and Game Show can lead to higher success rates.
